    <h2>Mission Work (선교)</h2>

    <p style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:cornflowerblue; padding: 15px; color:dodgerblue"> Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
        Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
        and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." (Matthew 28:18-20) </p>

    <p> To fulfill Jesus’ commandment, our church members go on short term mission trips every year after selecting mission trip locations in prayer.</p>

    <p>The following countries are the locations we have been to : </p>

    <p style="color:cornflowerblue"> Fiji in 2004 <br> China 2005 <br> Kyrgyzstan and Hopi Indians in Arizona in 2006 <br> Maui in 2007 <br> Cambodia in 2008 <br> Japan and Thailand in 2009 <br> 
        Israel in 2010 <br> Indonesia in 2012 <br> Vietnam in 2014 <br> Mongolia in 2015 <br> Turkey in 2016 <br> Israel in 2017 <br> Nepal 2018 <br>
        Greece & Roma 2019 <br> Kansas City & Kentucky 2021 <br> Kansas City 2022 <br> Poland, Hungary, Austria & Czech Republic 2023</p>

    <p> Short term mission trips give opportunities to preach a gospel to all nations and experience the power of Words and spiritual principles that we 
        learn at the church. Through mission trips, we have experienced a variety of signs that accompany believers (Mark 16:17-18). Mission trip takers 
        carry out miracles of healing and restoration, and help local pastors and missionaries to do the same miracles. We hope all the nations turn to 
        Jesus while mission trip teams are united with local missionaries and short term missions become long term missions.</p>
